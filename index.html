        <p>Located on the north rim of the Grand Canyon, the Isis Temple stands as a stoic reminder of the geological principles that have shaped the surface of the Earth. Millions of years of erosion have left a monument to nearly two billion years of geologic history exposed, ripe for observation. With 15 “quantifiable” layers, let’s identify each using the provided 360 degree view above. At the very top, look at the white streak cresting the top of the Temple. This is Coconino Limestone, a rock from the Permian period that is particularly resistant to erosion. This quality makes for a stunning white crown atop the red, browns, and tans found below. Below the cap, the Isis Temple slopes down before meeting a sheer face. The sloping part, and some of the first cliff face are made of Hermit Shale. Despite the misleading name, Hermit shale is actually a mixture of many siltstones and mudstones, with some fine-grain sandstones mixed in. Hermit shale is soft, which leads to the gentle slopes, as it erodes over time. Moving down the cliff face, the next slope is composed of the Subpai group, a collection of four, soft sandstones formed in the late Pennsylvanian and early Permian.  Below that, the impressive cliff face is comprised of Redwall Limestone, formed during the Mississippian. Further down still lay the characteristics lenses of the Temple Butte Formation, little pockets of red limestone from the Devonian that cut into the underlying Muav Limestone. Muav Limestone formed in the Cambrian, and can be seen in the grays and sandy thin-bedded colors beneath the Redwall cliffs. The red-grays and the greens below the Muav Limestone are made up of Bright Angel Shale, formed in the Cambrian. Right below, Shinumo Quatrzite forms brown and purple quartzites and massive bed of red and brown sandstone, that make up the cliffs below the Bright Angel Shale.  This layer formed during the Mesoproterozoic Era. The ddep purple nd virbant ornages near the base of the Temple are Hakatai Shale, another Mesoproterozoic rock. One more layer down is the bass formation, a Mesoproterozoic limestone that forms stair stepped cliffs. Thefinal visibale layer is called the Vishnu Basement Rocks which are primarilay made up of Proterzoic granites and schists. From recent formations to formations from 1840 Ma, the Isis Temple stands as a beautiful and historical marvel, much like the rest of the canyon. Each Layer allowed us to look back in time and piece together what was going on at the time. Two billion years of exposed layering remains one of the greatest ways we have learned about our contintent and the conditions it faced through development. </p>

        <p> While the Isis Temple sticks out with its white crest, Bright Angel Point, a popular tourist destination along the north rim. It has similar coloring and layering to the Isis Temple, wiith a couple small, but important deatails. Most evidentily, it contains layers above Coconino sandstone. At the very top, forming some of the gentle lopin cliffs is the Kaibab Formation, which consists of Permian limestones. It overlies the Toroweap Formation, a dark band of Middle Permian sandstone that contrasts with the brighter colored rocks above and below. Below the Toroweap marks the beginning of layering in the same sequence as the Isis Temple. The other key difference shows a geolgical process that is not as evident in the temple. Bright Angel Point is nearly 300 meters higher than its counter part on the south rim. This is indicative of exteme uplift and elevation, somehting that played a vital role  in the formation of the canyon and the way it looks today. The uplift is due to faults from tectonic procsses that permanently alter the hieght of the surface. </p>

        <p>Mather Point can be found on the south rim of the grand canyon, overlooking the Isis Temple. The principles of stritigarpahy are extremely evident in its slopes and cliffs. Its layering is nothing new, infact it is exactly the same as the layering at Bright Angel Point, and, once you get low enough, Isis Temple. As the principle of super position states, the lower you go, the older you get. From the information available about the layering and their ages, it is determinable that the super position holds here. The second evident princple it reinforces is that of lateral continuity. Despite the north and the south rim having millions of years of erosion and geologic proceses between them, their layers are still similar. This implies that, long ago, the deposited sediment must have formed large planes, and was then eroded to look how it does today. Finally, the principle of cross cutting can be see in the height difference between the two points. Bright Angel is 300 meters above Mather Point, yet contains, as stated above, identical layering. This means that the faults that have caused the difference in elevations must be younger than the formation of the most layers in the Grand Canyon. </p>
